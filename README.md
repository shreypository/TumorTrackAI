🧠 Brain Tumor Detection using Machine Learning
📌 Overview

This project focuses on building an AI-powered system for brain tumor detection using medical imaging scans (such as MRI).
The system not only detects the presence of a tumor but also provides information about its location, size, type, and stage.

The aim is to assist radiologists and healthcare professionals in faster, more accurate diagnosis while reducing human error.

🚀 Features

🩻 Tumor Detection – Classifies whether a tumor is present or not.

🎯 Tumor Localization – Identifies the region of the tumor in the brain scan.

📏 Size Estimation – Estimates tumor size in pixels/area.

🧬 Type Classification – Differentiates tumor types (e.g., Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary).

📊 Stage Prediction – Determines tumor stage based on size and spread.

🖥️ Visualization – Outputs segmented regions on MRI scans.

📊 Dataset

Source: Kaggle Brain MRI Dataset
 (replace with your dataset source)

Classes:

No Tumor

Glioma Tumor

Meningioma Tumor

Pituitary Tumor

Preprocessing steps include:

Resizing images to 224×224 pixels

Normalization (0–1 scaling)

Data augmentation (rotation, flipping, zoom)

🧑‍💻 Methodology

Data Preprocessing – Cleaning, resizing, augmentation.

Feature Extraction – Using CNNs to extract features from MRI scans.

Model Training – Deep learning models such as CNN / ResNet / VGG.

Tumor Localization – Region-based CNN (R-CNN) / segmentation models (U-Net, Mask R-CNN).

Tumor Size Calculation – Pixel area estimation of segmented tumor.

Stage Prediction –

Stage I: < 2 cm

Stage II: 2–4 cm

Stage III: 4–6 cm

Stage IV: > 6 cm
